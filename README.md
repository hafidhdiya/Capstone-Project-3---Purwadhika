## **Background**

Travel insurance has become an integral part of travel plans for many modern travelers. With increasing awareness of the risks associated with traveling, such as accidents, sudden illness, or lost luggage, the demand for insurance protection during travel is on the rise. One key aspect of travel insurance services is its ability to handle claims quickly and efficiently when emergencies occur.

Insurance claims are a vital process whereby policyholders apply for compensation for losses or damages incurred during the journey covered by the insurance policy. This can include everything from unexpected medical treatment costs to the replacement of lost travel expenses due to sudden cancellations. A company's ability to effectively manage claims is a key factor in determining customer satisfaction and building a solid reputation in the market.

## **Problem Statement**

In the context of travel insurance, the main challenge faced is determining whether a traveler will file an insurance claim or not when an emergency situation occurs during the journey. This requires accurate assessment of the situation, the traveler's needs and desires, as well as the ability to provide appropriate services and assistance in a timely manner. Therefore, the core issue is how to identify and understand the factors influencing an individual's decision to file a travel insurance claim, enabling insurance companies to design more effective strategies and processes in handling these claims.

## **Goal**

Developing a predictive model that can estimate whether a customer will file an insurance claim or not during a specific period.

## **Modelling Analytic Approach**

1. Data Analysis for Pattern Identification:
   
   - Collecting and analyzing historical customer data, including information on submitted and non-submitted insurance claims.
   
   - Utilizing data analysis techniques such as descriptive statistical analysis, correlation analysis, and data visualization to identify patterns or differences in behavior or characteristics between policyholders who file claims and those who do not.

2. Predictive Model Development:
   
   - Building predictive models using machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble algorithms like Random Forest.
   
   - Training the model using processed historical data to predict the probability of a policyholder filing an insurance claim or not in the future.

3. Model Validation and Evaluation:
   
   - Using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the curve (AUC) to assess model performance.
   
   - Validating the model using cross-validation techniques to ensure good generalization to new data.

4. Implementation and Optimization:
   
   - Implementing the detection model into the company's information system to support decision-making in risk management and insurance claim processes.
   
   - Performing model optimization periodically by updating customer data and adjusting model parameters to enhance prediction performance.

## **Project Limitation**

One limitation of this project stems from the inherent difficulty in managing an imbalanced dataset, which adds complexity to optimizing the balance between recall and precision in our classification model.
